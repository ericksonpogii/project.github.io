     <h2>highest-paid professional gamers in the world</h2>
     <p>It may sound too good to be true, but people actually play video games for a living.

And they make a killing.

E-Sports Earnings has ranked the 100 players with the highest overall earnings from competitive gaming.

Over 100 gamers have earned more than $250,000 in prize money alone, without counting the sponsorship deals and income that many of these players receive from streaming their practice games on services like Twitch.

But they pale in comparison to the top-10 players, who have earned more than $10 million for their gaming prowess alone.</p>
