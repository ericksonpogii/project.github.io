        <h3>Battleborn</h3>
            <p> Battleborn is the new kid on the block. Bringing in the element of FPS to the MOBA scene, something that is starting to get a lot of popularity, Battleborn is among the very few MOBA games that have taken the tough task of being an FPS MOBA. From the creators of Borderlands and Brother in Arms, Battleborn will look quite similar to people who have every played Smite, except there are no gods this time around. Having a big name behind its back, Battleborn is definitely going to be among the Top MOBA games in the times to come.</p>

        <h3>Paragon</h3>
            <p>Paragon is an upcoming third person MOBA game from Epic Games. Players will fight in 5v5 battles using skill based combat mechanics with different heroes having unique abilities to play with. We can give a plus to the game already just knowing the game developers of Paragon are the ones who created Unreal Tournament. Another unique addition to the game is card collections. In paragon, players can earn cards and manage their deck which can further be used to implement various strategies and plans in battles.</p>

        <h3>Supernova</h3>
            <p>Supernova brings back the old school MOBA thing back with a slight modification from the future. From the looks of the game, you may see Supernova as some updated version of Starcraft with better graphics. Things however, are a lot more interesting once you actually start getting a hold of the game. What’s unique about Supernova is the value it gives to the most underrated thing in any MOBA, Creeps. Supernova emphasizes a bit more on your creeps giving you the power to own you opponents not just with spells but through effective macroing as well. Not any Top MOBA has ever taken the liberty to do what Supernova has done and that is why many have fingers crossed for this upcoming MOBA.</p>

            <p>With the overgrowing competition in MOBA scene, gamers now have a wide variety of MOBA games to choose from based on the game play offered by the MOBA game. Many gamers tend to lean towards free MOBA games; however, this certainly doesn’t mean that paid MOBA games are not worth trying.</p>

        <h3>League of Legends</h3>
            <p>This game tops the chart of best MOBA games out there. The reason? Well, League of Legends (LoL) has generated $1 billion in revenue in 2014. And, it’s not just the money that propels it to the top of the charts. It’s more to do with the game play and experience that League of Legends provides to players through PvP format.</p>
