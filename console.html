     <h2>Best Video Game Consoles of 2016</h2>
     
     <hr>
        <h3>PlayStation 4</h3>
            <p> The PlayStation 4 serves up dazzling graphics, runs on a simplified and logical interface and boasts a fantastic controller. It has the upper hand in indie games and can stream a constantly growing list of legacy titles via PlayStation Now. The PS4 makes it super-easy to capture and broadcast gameplay online and generally delivers a zippier performance than its direct competition. It also doubles as a Blu-ray player and solid media-streaming box.</p>

        <h3>Microsoft Xbox One</h3>
            <p>Microsoft's Xbox One offers impressive graphics and a solid list of exclusive 2015 titles. The Microsoft console currently edges ahead of the PS4 with a better selection of media apps. The console's fall-2015 dashboard update is a noticeable improvement. The console has backward compatibility with around 100 Xbox 360 titles, and that list is poised to grow.</p>

        <h3>Nintendo Wii U</h3>
            <p>An included tablet-style GamePad can play games when the TV is in use; Nintendo has a core library of awesome exclusive titles; works with older Wii games and accessories; very kid-friendly. Access to a vault of your childhood classics. Off-TV play is great.</p>

            <p>With the overgrowing competition in MOBA scene, gamers now have a wide variety of MOBA games to choose from based on the game play offered by the MOBA game. Many gamers tend to lean towards free MOBA games; however, this certainly doesnâ€™t mean that paid MOBA games are not worth trying.</p>

        <h3>New Nintendo 3DS XL</h3>
            <p>The 3D screens are improved by new face-tracking, and the larger size offers a less cramped viewing experience. Internal tweaks and updates add a behind-the-scenes boost.</p>
            <br>
            <img src="img/New Nintendo 3DS XL.jpg" width="504" height="436">
            <p>The 3DS XL's improved 3D head-tracking is a big step up and its performance boost more makes a noticeable difference. A few head-scratching design choices prevent us from falling for the New 3DS XL, but this is still the best Nintendo portable to get.</p>
            <hr>

        <h3>PlayStation Vita Slim</h3>
            <p>The new Vita Slim charges with any Micro-USB cable, is thinner and lighter, has improved battery life, and works nicely as a PS4 accessory for local game streaming. The game library's gotten really good, too, including freebies for PS Plus subscribers.</p>
